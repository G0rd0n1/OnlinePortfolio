To further expand my knowledge in HTML5 and CSS3, I decided to create a beginners online portfolio using HTML5 Up to create the aesthetics of the webpage. At this point in time the information will be valid during my current position as a WeThinkCode_ student. I will later take this Portfolio and add other information such as projects I have worked/collabed on, I will also work on improving the layout and functionality and also making the webpage compliment who I am through the colors and background images.

NavigationBar-
  Expands on click
  Contains a little image of myself along with name and skills relating to career on the top of the bar.
  Links which will take you across the site:
    - Welcome_page
    - About
    - Experience
    - Education
    - Contact

Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

Installation
Since this code is still in the backend/production process. It can only be run from the localhosts terminal once cloning the repository. I will later publish the site and make it live once I am happy with the information available and layout.

Support
If you are having any issues with the webpage, have any ideas on improving my portfolio, or simply just want to speak code. Please feel free to contact any one of our lead developers:

Project status
Completed this Portfolio as a rough draft to the professional portfolio I hope to create once I am able to add on/ update the information on the current webpage
